Symbolic-1
--------------------

Symbolic-1 is a symbolic calculator made as a final project for a c++-course.

It features infix- and prefix parsing and defining and calling functions with arbitrary values and symbols, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponents. It also features rudimentary derivation rules.

All function trees are simplified by default, according to simplification rules. They're not perfect but they work surprisingly well.
